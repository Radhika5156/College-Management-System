# College Management System 

##  Project Overview
The College Management System is a database-driven project developed using MySQL ans SQL to manage core academic entities such as students, teachers, and departments. The project demonstrates practical implementation of relational database concepts, ER modeling, and SQL query execution using MySQL Workbench.

---

##  Technologies Used
- MySQL 8.0
- MySQL Workbench
- SQL

---

##  Database Design
The database is designed using an ER diagram and converted into relational tables with appropriate constraints.

### Entities
- Student
- Teacher
- Department

### Key Features
- Primary key and foreign key constraints
- Relational mapping based on ER diagram
- Structured data storage
- SQL-based data retrieval

##  How to Run the Project
1. Open **MySQL Workbench**
2. Connect to **Local instance MySQL80**
3. Execute `create_tables.sql` to create tables
4. Execute `insert_sample_data.sql` to insert sample records
5. Execute `queries.sql` to retrieve and verify data

---

##  Screenshots
The `screenshots` folder contains:
- Table creation queries
- Sample data output for Student, Teacher, and Department tables
- JOIN query output demonstrating foreign key relationships

---

##  Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of relational database design
- Hands-on experience with MySQL and SQL queries
- Implementation of ER diagrams into database schemas
- Practical use of primary and foreign keys
